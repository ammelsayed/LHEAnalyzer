# LHEAnalyzer

This is a python class that takes `.lhe` or `.lhe.gz` files as inputs and converts them into `.root` files with similar structure to that of Delphes `.root` files.
By default it only analyzes the _outgoing_ particles, and with user request it can also read and analyze the incoming and intermediate particles kinematics from the .lhe file.
The root files produced from this class can be used along with root files from Delphes to study the detector effiecent and way more useful physics.
